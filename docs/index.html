											<h2>Introduction</h2>

										<p>
											Choosing a college major is an important decision because it helps define what your future career will be.
											However, deciding what to major in can be very difficult because there are so many choices (there are approximately
											175 majors listed on this page alone). Choosing a major becomes even more difficult when you want to take into account
											not only what your interests are, but also other factors, such as pay for example. This webpage aims to make it easier
											for you to consider those “other factors” when selecting a major by allowing you to explore various visualizations. In each
											section, the factors you can choose to compare majors by are median pay, unemployment rate, percentage of men vs. women, and
											percentage of jobs that are full time vs. part time. The data for all of the sections below is from
											<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors">https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors</a>.
											Also, in each visualization on this page, you can hover over the elements in the visualization (a dot in the scatterplot or a bar
											in the bar charts) to view the exact value being displayed. Note that for the bar charts, if you do not see a bar for a major or category,
											the value for that factor and major or category is zero. Also, this website has the best viewing experience when using Chrome (you
											may see unexpected behavior when using other browsers).

									<h2>An Initial Exploration</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									To start you off on your search for a college major, explore the scatterplot below. All 175 majors are shown in the scatterplot and you can use
									the selectors to change which factor is displayed on the x and y axes. You can also hover over a point to see which major it corresponds to. The
									color of each point corresponds to the category of major it belongs to. As you explore the scatterplot, think about which factors are most important
									to you and which majors as well as categories of majors could be of interest to you based on those factors.

									Now that you have an idea of what factors are important to you, let’s take a closer look at the categories of majors.
									The chart below displays, for each category, the average value for the selected factor of the majors in that category.
									The selector below can be used to change which factor is displayed. In addition, you can click on a bar in the chart to
									see the top five majors for the factor you selected in the category that corresponds to the bar you clicked.

									<h2>Dive into Majors</h2>

								<p>
									After examining the categories of majors and top five majors for various factors and categories, you may
									have an idea of which majors could be real possibilities for you. This section aims to help you compare those
									majors and hopefully narrow down the list of majors you’re considering. Click the select majors button below to
									open a modal where you can select up to 15 majors. To save your changes, whether you select majors or click deselect
									all, click the select button on the modal. Once you select at least one major, you will see a bar chart below, displaying
									the values for the majors and factor you selected.

						<!-- Fourth Section -->

								<h2>Narrow down the Options</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								At this point, hopefully you have a relatively small list of majors you are still considering, perhaps around
								five majors or so. The goal of this section is to allow you to easily compare those majors on all factors to get
								a better idea of which major is the best for you. Similar to the previous section, click the select majors button
								below to open a modal where you can select up to 5 majors. Again, to save your changes, even after clicking deselect
								all, click the select button on the modal. Once you select at least one major, multiple bar charts will be displayed,
								showing the majors you selected and all factors.

								<h2>Down to One</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								You made it to the last section of this webpage! After exploring all those visualizations in the previous sections,
								we hope you have decided on a major. If you have, then you can see information about that major by selecting the major
								in the first drop-down box below and clicking the “Go” button next to it. If not, no worries, we have options for that
								too. If you’re interested in a particular factor, such as finding the major with the highest median pay for example, you
								can use the second set of drop-down options to select a factor and whether you want to see the major with the lowest or highest
								value for that factor, then click the “Go” button next to it. If you’re tired of looking at majors and still aren’t sure which one
								to choose, then try clicking the “Random Major” button and see which major pops up.
